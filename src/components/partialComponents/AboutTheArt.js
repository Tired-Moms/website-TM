				Being mother is a wonderful experience that changes your life, but it is
				also one of life’s biggest challenges. It means being 24 hours a day, 7
				days a week, without rest, sleepless nights, strenuous days, living
				emotional stress and self-pressure, thinking about food, clothes,
				cleaning, in short, giving everything for that little human being.{' '}

					Tired Moms is a collection of illustrations that pays tribute to moms
					around the world who feel overwhelmed, tired and who at times feel
					they can't handle everything. Thank you, moms, because despite feeling
					that you can no longer, you continue to give your all for your beloved
					children.

				My name is Giselle Escandón, from Colombia. I am an illustrator,
				cartoonist, industrial designer, mom and wife. I love coffee in the
				mornings and if fatigue doesn't win me over, in the evenings I love
				watching movies with my husband.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since I was a child, I have always loved drawing, crafts and
				storytelling through my creations, so dedicating myself to something
				creative as an adult was essential for me. I am currently a freelance
				illustrator and cartoonist, and together with my husband we have a
				creativity and design company, which has allowed me to work from home
				and dedicate much of my time to my one-year-old son. Although being a
				mom and working at home isn't always easy, I find this a wonderful
				experience I never thought I'd have.
